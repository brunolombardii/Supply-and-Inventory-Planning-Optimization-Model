# Supply and Inventory Planning Optimization Model

This repository contains an optimization model developed in **Pyomo** for supply and inventory planning. The model minimizes total costs while satisfying demands and adhering to operational constraints. This repository contains the implementation of a supply chain optimization model using Pyomo. The model is designed to handle various constraints and objectives for efficient planning and decision-making within a supply chain network.

## ðŸš€ Project Purpose
The model addresses:
- Inventory planning.
- Optimization of logistical resource usage.
- Penalties for failing to meet minimum requirements.
